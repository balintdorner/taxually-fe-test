Test\nThis document defines a coding test focused on frontend tech skills\nWe'd like you to put togeather a small responsive app (preferably in Angular, but React is fine), that has the following features / capabilities: \t\t\t\t\n\na login page\t\t\t\t\na page where the user can upload or delete the files (for example images or files are listed: up to you)\t\t\t\t\nPlease use Bootstrap or Tailwind \t\t\t\t\nPlease use some state management (Rxjs, store...)\t\t\t\t\nPlease write unit tests\n\n\t\t\nThe specification below contains the basic elements of the application. You are free to implement as much or as little detail as you like and as a rule of thumb: don't spend more than a few hours on the test overall.\nSpecification:\n\ncreate the registration (if no user) and login (if user) page. \nFields:\n\n\nfirst name \nlast name\nemail address\npassword (?)\n\n\nListing page\nAfter a successful login, the user is redirected to a listing page, where the user sees the uploaded images or files listed.\n\nThe user should be able to upload and delete files \n\nShow action status messages (after upload/delete)\n\nThe list should be sortable and filterable.\n\n\n\nBonus: Grouping for example using an accordion. Copy and move feature. Error handling\n\nYou don't need to implement any backend state. We are only interested in your frontend knowledge.\n(Tip: To store 'data' you can use: local storage, session storage, cookies, etc..)\nWe want you to present your skills and competencies in the in the way you feel reflects those best. It is not necessary to complete all tasks. It's more important that the completed tasks reflect the quality of your work. \nIf you have other projects that would you share with us / or would be interesting for us, we are happy to look at them, but keep in mind you only need to do the given/described task. \nCriteria / what we're looking for:\n\nplanning\nimplementation\ndeployment (git handling, commit message quality)\ndocumentation \ntesting\n\nPreferred Tech Stack:\n\nTypeScript\nAngular or React \nRxJS/NgRx\nBootstrap/Tailwind (SCSS/PostCSS etc..)\nJest\n\nTo develop and submit your solution please follow these steps:\n\nCreate a public repo in your own GitHub account and push the technical test there\nDevelop your solution and push your changes to your own public GitHub repo\nOnce you're happy with your solution send us a link to your repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
